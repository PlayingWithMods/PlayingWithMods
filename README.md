- 👋 Hi, I’m @PlayingWithMods
- 👀 I’m interested in writing mods for popular video games in order to become a stronger coder. Because nothing flexes your mind muscles like creating things you love.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Angular, JSON, SMAPI, and improving my skills in Discrete Mathematics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with artists! This is my weak spot. Right now, my current NPC is a blue square. 
- 📫 How to reach me: silverleafcanuck@gmail.com
