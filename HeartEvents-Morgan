2 HEARTS

Enter the Clinic on a weekday when it’s open.
Morgan is at Harvey’s clinic and coming out of her appointment

HARVEY: Morgan, I keep telling you, you need to source that slime from a farm instead of fooling around in those mines. They’re not safe. I’ve been telling this since you moved here.

MORGAN: Harvey, I keep telling YOU since I moved here that I NEED locally sourced slimes in order to study the specific type of bacteriophage that prays on the bacteria we’re seeing in decaying slime drops. Farmed slime comes from Yoba-knows-where, so it’s essentially useless.

HARVEY: Morgan, I understand how important your dissertation is to completing your thesis, but as your doctor, I have to insist you take better care of yourself.

MORGAN: Harvey, without a dissertation, I essentially have a bachelor’s degree in Biology. This IS me taking care of myself.

HARVEY: Suit yourself, Morgan, but the next time, you may wind up in here for something a lot worse than a slime burn. And you have a daughter to think about. Think about this, ok?(He leaves)

MORGAN: Oh, hey player. It’s nothing. I just got myself a nice little chemical burn from the slimes in the mine. They’re critical for my thesis, is the problem. One day, I’ll have a property big enough to have a slime hutch, but until then, I have to keep mining to find them.

PLAYER:
- Sorry to hear that, those things are pretty relentless. (No effect on friendship)
- Wish I could help, but I’m pretty focused on mining when I’m in there. (Minus friendship)
- Oh gee, sorry to hear about your issues getting your advanced degree. Meanwhile, I have to mine and then toil in the fields all day or I starve. Morgan, you’re kind of self-absorbed. (Minus minus friendship)
- Maybe I can help. I have some decent weapons. You can borrow them when I’m not mining. (Plus friendship)
- Maybe I can help. I could bring you back slime loot. I’m in there most days and I have some decent weapons. (Plus plus friendship)

MORGAN
- Yeah, they’re miserable. Oh well, don’t mind me. Maybe Clint can fashion me some protective armor or something. *smirk*
- Oh… well, I guess that’s understandable… 
- Weapons? That’s really generous of you, player. I’d only borrow them if I needed them. I’ve been going in there with Swiss Army knives so I think that might do the trick!
- Could you? That’s really nice… and… brave of you! I periodically request slime loot on the community board, and if you can supply a decent amount, I’ll give you credit in my dissertation. We’ll call it ‘field work’… Partner :) 



4 HEARTS

Enter Gus’s anywhere between 5pm and close.
Morgan is sitting with Willy, Jodi, and Demetrius discussing the fish biome.

MORGAN: All I’m saying, Jodi, is that our recent chemical spill has impacted the marine biome in a way that is going to take YEARS to rectify. I get the importance of the war effort, but….

JODI: We were defending ourselves against a Gotoro WMD up there. What should we have done? Morgan, with all due respect, you’re a virologist, not a marine biologist. And certainly not a foreign-policy specialist. 

MORGAN: I don’t give a toss about foreign policy, Jodi, I care about the aquatic biome crisis caused by the ‘war effort’. I respect that your husband is deployed, I really do. But that spill is not only going to affect our food supply, such a crisis is going to risk a potential extinction event if these events continue! 

DEMETRIUS: Well, I see Player has just joined us. Player, as a farmer, you’re probably sensitive to sustainability issues. It may be that the war with the Gotoro Empire is having a substantial impact on marine wildlife in, and around, Stardew Valley. What do you think? 

PLAYER
- Oooh guys. I’m not a good one to ask. I may be a farmer, but I’m not a scientist, and I don’t really understand current events around here yet. (No effect on friendship)
- If you’re worrying about your supply of fish tacos, don’t. Fish farms will continue to ensure that we have fish that is safe to eat, war or no war. (Minus friendship)
- Why don’t we just drop a nuke on Gotoro and flatten the entire Empire? Ecology is important! (Minus friendship)
- Guys, I am over this war and really don’t care about the fish it might kill. I’m just here to watch Gridball and relax, ok? (Minus minus friendship)
- Good question. I understand it’s important to protect wildlife during combat, but they DID shoot first. We really WERE just defending ourselves. It was a no-win situation. (Plus friendship)
- Good question. Maybe it would be a good idea to petition for mutually recognized ecological ‘safe zones’ so that we make sure the oceans are safeguarded and protected without compromising our troops’ safety. (Plus plus friendship)

MORGAN
- I understand, player. And just FYI, the more you know, the more confusing it all becomes.
- While I DO enjoy a good fish taco, I’m more concerned about aquatic balance. But, fair enough, I guess.
- Uh, because we don’t kill innocent people just because their government sucks? You know, player. I think the game is on. Why don’t you go not here and watch it?
- *sigh* I know, you make a fair point. I just feel like there could have been a better way.
- Actually? That’s not a bad idea. I might talk to Mayor Lewis about drafting… something? Gotta start somewhere, right?


6 HEARTS
Enter cindersap forest any time after 4pm on a Friday or Saturday when it’s not raining

MORGAN: Hey, player. Have a beer. 

PLAYER: 
- Are you having a picnic… alone? (No effect on friendship)
- Are you drinking in the woods? That’s sort of… cool? (No effect on friendship)
- Are you ok? (No effect on friendship)

MORGAN: Have you met my daughter Sara? 

PLAYER:
- I have, she’s a really clever, sweet kid! (Plus hearts)
- I have, she’s a total brat (minus hearts)
- I haven’t yet, but I’ve seen her around. (No effect on friendship)

MORGAN: We used to live in Zuzu City. I did my first degree there, BSc in Biology. I wound up having a relationship with one of my professors when I was an undergrad. He was nice enough, but for me, it was just supposed to be fun. After awhile, I broke it off. Not because I was being mature. The exact opposite. I wanted to have the university experience, you know? Date people, be stupid, not have to disclose to the department or answer to anybody long term. After we broke up, I found out I was pregnant. Sara is his daughter. I never told him. I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to have a future with him. I thought I was so clever, you know? Like, ok, here we are, mom and kid, living the dream. We don’t need anybody. We can do this on our own. And sure, so far, we have. Thanks to research grants I’ve been lucky enough to get, and thanks to my best friend Oliver and Felix (my brother), we’ve managed to do pretty well. But… sometimes I wonder if I should have gone back to my ex. And his stable income. And his kindness. He would have loved Sara. Sometimes I feel like… I owe her more.

PLAYER
- You’re not to blame for what DID happen, but your ex deserves to know he has a child. (No effect on friendship)
- Yeah, ok. Keep it from him until you need money, then spring him with child support? Is that your angle? (Minus friendship)
- Morgan, quit this dumb PhD and hope the man takes you back. You clearly can’t do any of this on your own. (Minus minus friendship)
- I don’t know what the right thing to do might be, but I… went through something similar when I decided to come here. I can’t imagine what that would have been like if I’d had a small child to think about too. I’m here for you. (Plus plus friendship)
- Oh wow, Morgan. I don’t know what to say. He does deserve to know he has a child, but you were so young when it all happened. I can’t imagine being in that position. I’m here for you, for what it’s worth. (Plus friendship)


8 HEARTS

Enter Morgan’s flat any time on the weekend. 

MORGAN: Hey player! Great news! I’ve completed my experiment! I’ll be ready to defend my thesis soon! Hey… player? I wouldn’t have been able to complete my work had it not been for you. Without you, I might not be getting my PhD right now. Thank you. So much. 

PLAYER:
- Did I really do that much though? (No effect on friendship)
- Whatever I did to help, I’d happily do it again (No effect on friendship)
(8 Hearts achieved after this event)

MORGAN: You did so much. Forget any actual help, you were here to support me when I really needed it. I was starting to think I was kind of on my own. But it turns out, I have a real … friend. Thank you. Player? I… that is, I wanted to say… Never mind.

*Player can now give Morgan the bouquet at any time*


10 HEARTS

*player gets a letter in the mail* “Can you meet me at U Zuzu? There’s something I want to show you.”

Player arrives

MORGAN: Player! Thanks for coming! Look! Look at this!

Morgan shows player a microscope. Player looks and sees tiny little bacteria swimming around.

MORGAN: Remember the slime you gave me (if player did not give slime “Abigail got this slime for me!”) It turns out that that slime contained the bacteria strain that I was looking for. And that bacteria right here, see how it’s blue in colour? That blue color indicates the presence of the virus! This virus can be used to fight the slime sickness everyone has been coming down with. This virus is harmless to us, but will kill that bacteria. (If player gave slime) I’m finally finishing my research because of you! (If player did not give slime) I’m finally finishing my research and I wanted to share it with you. 

MORGAN: You came here with nothing but the deed to that old derelict farm. And you turned it into something wonderful. You inspired me in ways I didn’t think I needed to be inspired.

PLAYER:
- You always seemed inspired enough for both of us.
- How did I inspire you? You were the one who has inspired me.
- I’m so glad I was able to help you do something so important.

MORGAN: (response to all) You are all the things I wish I was. And that farm is all things good about Stardew Valley. I…. 

*Morgan and player kiss*

/////// If player has not given Morgan a bouquet, run bouquet override code. Morgan gives player bouquet.
////// If player has given Morgan a bouquet, event ends here.

MORGAN: @ I… I have something I wanted to give you… It’s no big deal, but… would you accept this?

PLAYER:
- You feel the same way? I accept this!
- Morgan, I value our friendship, but I think you’ve got the wrong idea here.
- Morgan, I value our friendship, but I am not attracted to women.

MORGAN:
- I’m so glad. I have a secret… I got it awhile ago. A week after we met…
- Oh I… I’m so embarrassed. I’m sorry. Please keep it. If you ever change your mind, give it back to me. Or maybe someday, you’ll make a lucky person very happy.
- Oh! I had no idea! Please keep it as a token of our friendship, maybe someday you’ll make a lucky man very happy.
